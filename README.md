ðŸŸ¢: Builds correctly. Considered ready for use.

 MacOS X*: Support for this OS has a very low chance of happening due to the following reasons:
 - An Apple computer is necessary for any up-to-date development, which I wouldn't use anyways
 - I can't be bothered enough to set up a Hackintosh virtual machine for the sole purpose of this repo's development. I would still be limited to x86/x86_64 releases of MacOS X
 - I'm a student living with my parents in what could be considered a middle-low class home
 - I like doing other things other than coding lol
